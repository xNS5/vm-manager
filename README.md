# VM Manager

This is a simple menu bar application that does the following:

* Lists all installed virtual machines in a specific directory
* Launches either a GUI or headless VM instance
* Once the VM is running, an extra element will show up allowing the user to kill the VM

Please note this project is in its infancy. As of this update, I just have a basic UI in the works. SwiftUI is an interesting language to work in, but unfortunately the documentation isn't the clearest.
